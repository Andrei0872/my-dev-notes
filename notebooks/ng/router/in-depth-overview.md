# An in depth overview of `@angular/router`

* applying redirects 
  * don't have do manually call `router.navigate` in order to redirect, you can simply return an `UrlTree` instance
  * where `NoMatch` errors occur
  * `DFS` applied on the `route config object` until the **first** match is found
  * the module specified in `loadChildren` is loaded ?
  
  * `createChildrenForEmptySegments` what effect has on the further phases in the chain?
  ```ts
  // segm: 'a/b/c'
  {
    path: 'a/b',
    children: [
      { path: '', outlet: 'named' }, // `named`
      { path: 'c', }, // `primary`
    ],
  }
  ```

## Getting to know the `UrlTree`

* introduce `UrlParser`
* diff between this tree and the one created from `RouterState` or `RouterStateSnapshot`

---

## Route matcher

---

## ActivatedRouteSnapshot and ActivatedRoute

---

## Route Guards

* when `UrlTree` is returned, it means `redirect`

---

## Router Phases

### _Apply Redirects_ phase

* `NoMatch` errors occur; in this phase it is ensured that the path which would trigger a route navigation has a math among the declared routes(`Routes`)
* `canLoad` guard is invoked
  * can return a `UrlTree` instance, which will result in a redirect operation
  * this means that lazy-loaded modules are loaded during this phase; the resulted module, along with the `routes` specified by it are going to be stored for the subsequent phases;
    the config will be store in `_loadedConfig`
  * in order for a module to be successfully loaded, if any `canLoad` guards are present, all of them must return `true`
    if at least once `false` is returned - the current navigation will be cancelled and a `NavigationCancel` event will be sent
    if at least once `UrlTree` is returned - it will schedule a **new navigation**
* %include redirects
