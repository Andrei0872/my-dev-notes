# Exploring the HttpClientModule in Angular

<!-- Preface -->
In this post, we are going to understand how the `HttpClientModule` actually works behind the scenes and find answers to some questions that might have arisen while using this module.

_Note: This article is based on **Angular 8.2.x**_.

## What is HttpClientModule?

<!-- A brief description -->
The `HttpClientModule` is a **service module** provided by Angular that allows us to perform **HTTP requests** and easily manipulate those requests and their responses. It is called a **service module** because it **only instantiates services** and **does not export** any components, directives or pipes.

## Let's start exploring ðŸš§

_This is a section that I'll be referencing a lot during the next section, [Connecting the dots](#connecting-the-dots). 
Here I'm just exposing each significant **entity** that belongs to this module along with its explanation_.

* show module
* paragraphs which describe the purpose of each entity
* `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS`

These are the *services* this module provides:

### HttpClient

With the help of this service, we are able to specify how we want to communicate with the server. It comprises the methods for the well-known HTTP verbs:

```typescript
export class HttpClient {
    constructor(private handler: HttpHandler) {}
  
    /* ... Method overloads ... */
    request(first: string|HttpRequest<any>, url?: string, options: {}): Observable<any> {
      /* ... */
    }
   
    /* ... Method overloads ... */
    delete(url: string, options: {}): Observable<any> {
      return this.request<any>('DELETE', url, options as any);
    }
    
    /* ... Method overloads ... */
    get(url: string, options: { /* ... */ } ): Observable<any> {
      return this.request<any>('GET', url, options as any);
    }

    /* ... Method overloads ... */
    post(url: string, body: any|null, options: { /* ... */ }): Observable<any> {
      return this.request<any>('POST', url, addBody(options, body));
    }
    
    /* ... Method overloads ... */
    put(url: string, body: any|null, options: { /* ... */ }): Observable<any> {
      return this.request<any>('PUT', url, addBody(options, body));
    }
  }
```

<!-- TODO: add link for `DI token` -->
The `HttpHandler` is a **DI token** which maps to `HttpInterceptingHandler`, to which we will have a look later.  
As you can see, the `request()` method is called in each case.  
The `addBody()` function simply **merges** the provided **objects**.

#### `HttpClient.request()`

This method returns an **observable** that, when subscribed to, will allow us to **send the request** to the server.

Here's the gist of it:

```typescript
```

## Questions

<!-- Notes -->

### Other topics
* how does Angular send the HTTP requests?
* the 2 ways of creating a header
* why not to import the HttpClientModule twice
* retry intercetpro(line: 487)
* understanding the `reduceRight` method and eventually why it has been used
* understanding the flow of the request
* how does Angular aborts requests ? `xhr.abort()`
* why should the module be imported only once, in the `AppModule` ?

### HttpInterceptingHandler
  * explain(if u haven't doen it already), to the this class got there
  * explain `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS`
  * everything starts when `res$` is subscribed to(by using `httpClient.{get|post|etc...}.subscribe()`)
  * `events$` is part of res, so when `res$` is subscribed to, the logic inside `events$` will run
  * explain using the linked list analogy

### HTTP_INTERCEPTORS
* where it comes from
* explain what's inside that file(the interface, the )
* `HttpInterceptorHandler`
* explain the order of HttpInterceptors
* why `next.hadle(req).pipe(/* access the response here */)`
* how does **retrying** work?

### leafs
  * `HttpHeaders`
    * headers instance
    * headers obj
    * string: split by `\n`
    * when `typeof headers === 'string'`
      * when an instance is created from  `partialFromXhr()`
  * `HttpParams`
  * `HttpRequest` - creating the actual request object
    * `third`(body, if body not specified(`GET`), this will be the `options`)
    * `fourth`(if body is specified as `third`, this will be the `options`)
  * `HttpResponse`
    * `HttpEvent`
  * `HttpHeaderResponse`
    * partial response(no body)
    * when **progress events** are **requested**

## TODO

- [ ] provide breakpoints in order to understand the flow
- [ ] check the existence of `X-XSRF-TOKEN` in network tab

```typescript
backend = {
  handle (req): Observable<any> { }
}

class InterceptorHandler () {
 constructor () { }
 
 handle (req) { }
}


[ i1, i2, i3 ].reduceRight((next, i) => new InterceptorHandler(i, next), backend) 



o1 = intHandl(i3, be)

o2 = intHandl(i2, o1)

o3 = intHandl(i1, o2);

o3.handle(req)
```
