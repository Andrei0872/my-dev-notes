# Exploring the HttpClientModule in Angular

In this post, we are going to understand how the `HttpClientModule` actually works behind the scenes and find answers to some questions that might have arisen while using this module.

_Note: This article is based on **Angular 8.2.x**_.

## Setting up

My favorite way to understand how things really work is by using the debugger while having the source code in my text editor so that I can explore and make assumptions easily.

### Installing Angular on your machine

```bash
git clone -b 8.2.x --single-branch https://github.com/angular/angular.git
```

### StackBlitz

You can find a StackBlitz demo [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ng-understanding-http).

We are going to use it throughout the article in order to get a better understanding of how entities are connecting with each other.

## What is HttpClientModule?

The `HttpClientModule` is a **service module** provided by Angular that allows us to perform **HTTP requests** and easily manipulate those requests and their responses. It is called a **service module** because it **only instantiates services** and **does not export** any components, directives or pipes.

---

## Let's start exploring ðŸš§

Once in the StackBlitz project:

* open the dev tools

* head over to `token.interceptor.ts`(CTRL + P) and put a breakpoint on `line 9`

* refresh the _StackBlitz browser_

Now, you should see something like this:

By clicking on the _anonymous function_ from `clint.ts`, you are now in the `HttpClient` class, which is the one you usually inject in your services.

As you might have expected, this class comprises the methods for the well-known HTTP verbs.

<img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpclient.png" style="text-align: center;">

I'd kindly recommend switching over to your text editor and start exploring this `HttpClient.request` method a little.


Continuing on, put a breakpoint on the `line 492` and refresh the browser. The most interesting part is just about to begin!

<img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpevents.png" style="text-align: center;">

At this point, we can't step into `this.handler.handle()` because the observable is just being built and has no subscribers yet. So, we must manually set a breakpoint inside the `handle` method.

To do so, switch over to your text editor and scroll up to the `constructor`.
The `HttpHandler` is a **DI token** that maps to `HttpInterceptingHandler`. 

<span id="providers">Here's a list of all providers</span>: 

<img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/img2.png" style="text-align: center;">

What's left to do is to go into `HttpInterceptingHandler` class and set a breakpoint inside the `handle` method.

After successufully identifying its location, switch back to your dev tools, add your breakpoint and resume the execution!

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpintercepting.png"></div>

_`BarInterceptor` is provided in `app.module`_

Here we are able to grab all the interceptors by injecting the  `HTTP_INTERCEPTOR`(a **multi-provider token**) inside our method.

The next step consists of creating the **injectors chain**.  
But first, let's have a quick look at `HttpInterceptorHandler`:

<img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpinterceptor.png" style="text-align: center;">

I like to think of this **chain** as a **linked list** that is built starting off from the **tail node**.

In order to get a better overview of this, I'd suggest that you keep resuming the execution until you reach `line 42`, while paying attention to what's going on in the `Scope` tab.

Now, we can go through the list starting off from the `head node` by stepping into the `handle` function from `line 42`. 

Here's how this linked list could look like:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpinterceptors.jpg">
</div>

Judging by the image above, we can tell that every `next.handle()` **returns** an **observable**.
What this means is that every interceptor can add custom behavior to the returned observable. Those **changes** will **propagate** in the **precedent interceptors**.

Before going any further, let's focus our attention on `this.backend`. Where does it come from? If you take a look at the **constructor**, you should see that is provided by `HttpBackend`, which maps to `HttpXhrBackend`(if not sure why, check [what this module provides](#providers)).

### Let's explore `HttpXhrBackend`

_Setting some breakpoints here and there will definitely lead to a better understanding! :)_

<div id="httphandle"></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/httpbackend.png">
</div>

The first thing that leaps to the eye is the `handle()` method, which is also the last method called in the **interceptor chain** because it sits in the **tail** node. It is also responsible for **dispatching** the request.

* `partialFromXhr` - extracts the `HttpHeaderResponse` from the current `XMLHttpRequest` and memoizes it; this object needs to be computed only once can be used in multiple places. For example, it used in the `onLoad` and `onError` events

* `onLoad` -  the callback function **triggered** when the **response** is **fully available**; it also **parses** and **validates** the **body** of the response

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="../screenshots/articles/exploring-httpclientmodule/canLoad.png">
</div>

* `onError` - the callback function called when a **network error** occurred during the request

Lastly, it is important to mention that the returned observable from `HttpXhrBackend.handle()` will dispatch the request when we subscribe to one of the `HttpClient`'s methods(`get`, `post` etc). This means that `HttpXhrBackend.handle()` returns a **cold observable**.


* this will get subscribed to through `concatMap`

<!-- IMAGE! -->
```typescript
this.httpClient.get(url).subscribe() -> of(req).pipe(concatMap(req => this.handler.handle))
```

The callback returned from the observable will be **invoked** when the **observable**  **stops emitting** values. That is, when an **error** or a **complete** notification occurs.

<details>
<summary>onComplete</summary>
<br>


```typescript
const obsBE$ = new Observable(obs => {
  timer(1000)
    .subscribe(() => {
      obs.next({ response: { data: ['foo', 'bar'] } });

      // Stop receiving values!
      obs.complete();
    })

    return () => {
      console.warn("I've had enough values!");
    }
});

obsBE$.subscribe(console.log)
/* 
-->
response
I've had enough values!
*/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>onError</summary>
<br>


```typescript
const be$ = new Observable(o => {
  o.next('foo');

  return () => {
    console.warn('NO MORE VALUES!');
  }
});

be$
 .pipe(
    flatMap(v => throwError('foo')),
 )
  .subscribe(null, console.error)
/* 
-->
foo
NO MORE VALUES
*/
```
</details>

---

Based on the acquired knowledge, we are now able to answer some questions!

## How can a request be canceled?

A common case is the **typeahead** feature:

```typescript
this.keyPressed
    .pipe(
        debounceTime(300),
        switchMap(v => this.http.get(url + '?key=' + v))
    )
```

It is advised to do things this way. The reason is due to `switchMap`'s magic, which will **unsubscribe** from the **inner observable** to handle the next emitted value.

```typescript
const src = new Observable(obs => {
  obs.next('src 1');
  obs.next('src 2');
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    obs.next('src 3');
    obs.complete(); 
  }, 1000);

  return () => {
    console.log('called on unsubscription')
  };
});

of(1, 2)
  .pipe(
    switchMap(() => src)
  )
  .subscribe(console.log)

/* 
src 1
src 2
called on unsubscription
src 1
src 2
src 3
called on unsubscription
*/
```

`1` is emitted and while we are **waiting** for the **inner observable** to complete, another value, `2`, comes straight away and will make `switchMap` unsubscribe from the current inner observable which in turn will invoke the returned function from the observable.

Here is what is going on inside the function returned from the observable that dispatches the request(found in [HttpXhrBackend.handle](#httphandle)):

```typescript
return () => {
    /* Skipped some lines for brevity... */

    xhr.removeEventListener('error', onError);
    xhr.removeEventListener('load', onLoad);
    
    // Finally, abort the in-flight request.
    xhr.abort();
}
```

Thus, we can infer that if the observable that made the request is unsubscribed from, the above callback will be invoked.


* HttpBackend
    * explain the response events and how can they be `intercepted`


* show retry behavior
    * retry operator
    * resubscribe(after refresh token is received)
